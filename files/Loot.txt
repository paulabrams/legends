Loot
An adventure from rags to riches

Introduction
Loot is a game is about waking up in a strange and dangerous place, surviving, and acquiring loot. Each player takes on the role of a character, who attempts to survive, explore, and find loot. The game ends when they get rich and escape to safety, or there are no survivors. One player also serves as the guide to the world, the disembodied narrator of the wildlife film you are starring in.

Loot is a cooperative game, consisting of a friendly, lighthearted and collaborative conversation between all the players. The guide describes the world and helps the players navigate its perils, faithfully describing what they can see, answering questions, and guiding the players towards meaningful choices. The players are their characters during the game. Players should ask questions and consider their actions carefully, both from the perspective of their characters and themselves. Players should always remember that the world is their adversary, not the guide.

The world is a dangerous, deadly place, filled with wonder and lots of loot. You keep what you kill.

AI Prompt: Suggest 6 new named characters, novices with no experience, 20 words each, Robert E Howard.

When the game starts you will wake up wearing rags, with no equipment. The guide will describe your surroundings, and the world will probably try to kill you. Sounds like a good time to look for loot!
Loot
The focus of this game is adventuring in dangerous places and acquiring loot, such as items of equipment, treasure, and magic items. Sometimes you will find loot that isn’t nailed down and can just take it, but other times it will be guarded by hazards such as monsters, traps, or its current owner.

Most loot consists of mundane objects, such as a stick, rope, water flask, or a sharp knife. You’d be surprised what you can do with these things if you are clever. You’re going to need to be clever to survive.
Learning Items
You need to learn an item before you can use it to its full potential. For example, if you find a sword then you need to spend some time practicing with it and feeling the balance of that sword, before you have it all dialed in. The guide will gauge your chances against the world better if you are using loot you have learned.

You can learn one item after you spend several hours training with the item. So, you can usually learn one item per day, assuming a normal day out and about, and then rest time back at camp.

Time is precious, so you may need to carefully weigh your choices of which item to learn.
While everybody knows how to use simple everyday items like shovels and rope, not everybody can use them to their full potential.
Each item is considered different unless mass-manufactured, such as general-issue cavalry sabres, matches, a hammer, etc.
Some rare items have more than one part to learn.
Taming/training a pet also works this way
You cannot learn items when deprived.
Fast Learner
You can learn an item much more rapidly if it is similar to an item you already know, or is related to our character description. So, you can learn familiar item along with a normal item. An ex-soldier can rapidly learn a cutlass, an archer will find it easy to learn new bows, and a mage will find it easy to learn more spell scrolls, etc.
Combat
Fighting is always a choice, but rarely a wise one. As always, make sure you stack the odds in your favor by describing how you are approaching the situation in a clever way.

You could potentially use an item to help avoid injury, such parrying with a shield or a sword. For best results mention this in the conversation so the guide has this top of mind, but don’t expect much benefit until you learn the item. Armor is also great if you can find or make it, again just be sure to talk about it.
Caches
While you will always feel excited when you find new loot, after you stop to rest you will realize how heavy a lot of it is. So, you will feel compelled to cache some loot each time you make camp or rest. Nobody wants to carry around lots of heavy, bulky items such as crates, so those get dropped first. Same goes with extra weapons and armor, and anything else that doesn’t seem essential. Since you might want the loot later, you cache it, that is you store it and mark the spot so you can find it later. You must always cache at least one item when you make camp or rest. You’ll develop a long line of caches over time. If you can, it’s not a bad idea to cache extra food or water just in case. 

You’re doing this for own good. It’s a good idea to stay fast and nimble, as you might need to run fast. Having caches to run back to will also be very helpful some day.
Bases
At some point you’ll probably want to build a safe place of some kind, a base. You’ll want to choose the location carefully, and you will probably spend time fixing it up and consolidating your caches here.

Survival
Survival is a major part of the game, especially on your first night and early days into the game. You will need to find food, water, shelter, and other essentials of life.
Deprivation
You are deprived if you lack a crucial need (food, water, sleep, etc).  You will lack your full energy and cannot learn or untap items.

You are also more likely to make mistakes. The guide may regretfully have to inform you that your latest plan failed or some other mishap occurred.

So, for your protection you should always eat a meal and drink water whenever you stop to rest, learn an item, sleep, or untap an item. Otherwise the things in the world might see you as easy prey…
Injury
If you become injured then you should try to hole up and rest, and play out your healing process in the conversation. You will not be able to heal if deprived, but otherwise you have a lot of time on your hands to learn items.
Changing Characters
At some point you will need to change characters. Your current character might get mangled, die, or be out of commission healing for a long time. You might find all the loot you need to retire happily and escape to safety. Or you just might just want to try a new character.

When you make a new character, you can transfer loot from your old character. Your new character will need to learn loot normally.The Guide
As the guide, your role is to serve as the players’ guide to the world. You are not the world, you are a cooperative guide to the world. This is an important distinction because the world is strange and dangerous. The world is the adversary, not you.

You will need to decide on a general concept such as a genre and starting location. Do you want a deserted island? A land of the lost? A dark and dingy city of thieves? You can do anything you want.
An Emergent World
Don’t sweat the world. This will emerge through play, starting with the local area where the players are right now. You can optionally prepare some of this ahead of time, or use a prewritten world, but don't over-prepare. Try to keep the world mysterious for as long as possible; avoid providing any background info up-front, and dole it out slowly.

Barbarian Sands: A desert wasteland filled with nomadic tribes and ancient mysteries.
Dark Forest: A haunted wood teeming with mythical creatures and supernatural perils.
City of Thieves: A sprawling metropolis ruled by ruthless criminal syndicates.
Isle of Shadows: A cursed island where deadly secrets lurk in every shadow.
Savage Frontiers: A lawless frontier beset by savage tribes and bloodthirsty outlaws.
Eldritch Ruins: A forgotten land overrun by eldritch horrors and forbidden magic.

Tell the players that their characters wake up in rags, with none of their prior belongings, and briefly describe what they see. Then step back and see what the players do.

Blinking away disorientation, you find yourself surrounded by debris and fellow castaways. The distant sound of crashing waves echoes in your ears.

Answer any questions the players have helpfully, but the players do not know where they are, and have little or no memory of what happened.
The Conversation
Most of the game consists of a loose conversation between you and the players. You will describe what they see, they will ask questions, you’ll answer, etc. Sometimes you will describe things that happen and the players say how they respond, other times the players will take the initiative and you’ll respond with what happens. Just keep it natural and go with the flow.

For the most part, just go with what makes the most sense to you in the moment and what would be the most fun for everyone. If the players describe something sensible then let it happen! If they describe something unwise or infeasible then describe the natural consequences. But above all, keep it fun.

Example: The players are in a town and ask you if there is a shop with a back door left unlocked. They are probably looking to cause some mischief or loot the place, which sounds fun, so just go with it.
The Fog of War
This is an adventure game, so not everything should go smoothly and be predictable, and even perfect plans don’t always work. Or sometimes the character is the underdog and somehow survives.

During the conversation you should frequently roll a die, with a 1-in-6 chance of an outcome that will be surprising to everyone. This could be the opposite of what “should” have happened, or the surprise might be some cost. Or the character might escape what seemed like certain doom. The result should even be surprising to you!

You should also adjust your roll for factors that should affect the odds.
Advantage. Roll again to back up a “1”. For example, the expert archer is shooting their bow.
Disadvantage. Roll again to back up a “not 1”. For example, the spindly wizard is trying to use a heavy weapon.
Extremes. Roll a third time if the Advantage or Disadvantage seems really extreme. For example, Robin Hood is shooting his bow.
Combat
The world is dangerous, and the characters have a very good chance of dying. The characters will often be outnumbered or at a disadvantage, so their only hope is their wits. Fighting is always a choice, but rarely a wise one.

Combat is just another part of the conversation, and the most likely outcome should happen. A character who swims with reef sharks will probably get eaten. Tangling with pirates will probably end up with someone getting sliced by a cutlass.

That outcome will happen, barring the 1-in-6 chance of a surprise. But use Advantage/Disadvantage for character expertise, weapons, positioning, high ground, flanking, ambushes, and other clever tactics.
Consequences
Fights to the death usually end with someone dying. If the characters tangle with something way outside their weight class they will probably die. However, consider something less permanent if the fight seems lighter, if it's early in the fight, or if the combatants seem more likely to flee than fight to the death. Outcomes other than death should hamper the character, so that the player needs to adjust how they play for a little while until they heal.

Sprain. Can’t use one limb (hand, elbow, shoulder, ankle, knee, hip).
Rout. Forced to retreat, possibly bleeding, maybe into bad territory.
Slammed. Smashed to the ground, breath knocked out, helpless.
Stunned. Hit hard and disorientated, helpless.
Saving Throws
If you want to tone down the deadliness you can opt to give the characters a second chance (1-in-6) to avoid the above outcome. Give the player Advantage if they mentioned they are leveraging their armor or other protective items, to reward clever play.
A Humble Servant
We recommend you introduce a “humble servant” character who can act as your voice in the game. Speaking through a character often feels more natural than using your disembodied narrator voice.

This person will ideally be someone you feel comfortable portraying with a distinctive voice or mannerisms, which you find fun to roleplay. Choose someone in a minor support role. Avoid characters who take the lead “hero” role in any area other than the campsite, so avoid choose fighters, scouts, mages, etc.

Mildred - Cheerful cook, plump figure, dreams of owning a bustling café.
Agnes - Meticulous cleaner, sharp-eyed, aspires for a pristine mansion.
Gerald - Patient gardener, weathered hands, desires a flourishing botanical garden.
Samuel - Diligent farmer, strong physique, longs for abundant harvests.
Beatrice - Artistic seamstress, graceful, dreams of a prestigious fashion show.
Percy - Resourceful handyman, jovial, wants a fully-equipped workshop sanctuary.

AI Prompt: Suggest 6 minor characters who can help with a singular kind of mundane task, such as cooking, cleaning, gardening, farming, mending. Include a one-word personality trait and a one-word physical trait. Describe something they want. 10 words each, Robert E Howard.
Magic Items
If you want to, you can introduce magic items as loot. Magic always takes the form of items, and requires using the item to invoke the magic. For example, a character who learns a spell scroll needs to keep the scroll and refer to while casting the spell. A character who is a “wizard” would be a fast learner for magic items, but still requires items to cast spells.

Characters must learn the magic of the item before they can invoke its magic. If the item has more than one magic ability then each needs to be learned separately. If the item has a mundane function, such as a sword or a rope, then that is also learned separately.
Tap / Untap
Whenever a character uses magic, there is a 1-in-6 chance they will use up the magic, and the item is tapped. Magic from that item won’t work until the player finds a way to untap the item. Some powerful items may allow tap/untap for specific magic powers, but most items work at the “item level”.

Untapping varies per item, but the simplest approach is to have items untap when characters sleep. That also makes for the interesting possibility of dream sequences influenced by the magic that is being untapped, and players will quickly learn to be careful what magic they invite into their dreams. Characters can’t untap items when deprived.Minor Magic Items

Built for AI
I designed Loot to play to the strengths of current AI chats. I asked an AI to provide the examples in this book. Now we can create as many examples for inspiration we like, for any genre or author style. You can even ask an AI to play the role of the guide.

AI Prompt: Assume the role of a helpful guide to a mysterious island in a novel where I wake up in rags without any of their belongings. Describe what I see and then stop and wait for my input. When you respond, roll 1d6 and on a 1 describe something surprising. Write in the style of Robert E Howard, 1 paragraph.

AI: The first light of dawn crept over the jagged horizon, casting a pale glow upon the forgotten shores of this accursed isle. Aye, stranger, as ye wake from yer slumber, ye'll find yerself clad in naught but tattered rags, stripped of all yer earthly possessions. Fear not, for I, your trusty guide in this desolate realm, shall lead ye through the secrets and perils that lie ahead.
As ye rise from the sandy shore, ye'll behold a landscape that defies description. Towering cliffs, their weathered faces etched with time's cruel touch, stand guard over the untamed wilderness that stretches before ye. The air hangs heavy with the scent of brine and decay, and the cacophony of strange cries and whispers echoes through the dense foliage. The vegetation itself appears otherworldly, with twisted trees and thorny vines that seem to writhe in a sinister dance. Before ye stretches a path, barely discernible amidst the undergrowth, beckoning ye to embark on a journey that shall test the limits of yer mettle.
Now, stranger, what say ye? Do ye dare tread upon this enigmatic realm and seek the truth that lies hidden within its heart?

> I look for useful cargo from the shipwreck, and make a pile a bit above the reach of the tide.

AI: As you search the shoreline for salvageable items from the shipwreck, your keen eyes spot fragments of wood and scattered debris scattered along the sandy beach. The remnants of a shattered mast lie half-buried in the sand, its timeworn splinters jutting out like skeletal fingers. Nearby, a broken crate reveals a jumble of soggy parchment and waterlogged supplies. You gather what you can salvage, arranging them in a makeshift pile just beyond the reach of the tide. Among your findings are a rusted cutlass with a worn leather grip, a weathered map that shows a crude trail leading through the heart of the jungle, and a small leather pouch filled with shimmering, iridescent shells. As you stand back to survey your meager collection, a glint of metal catches your eye. You bend down to investigate and discover a gleaming silver amulet half-buried in the sand, its intricate designs hinting at hidden significance. What will you do next, traveler?

> I arm myself with the cutlass, dump the shells into the crate, and hang the pouch from my belt. I look at the amulet, what are the designs and what might they mean?

AI: You grasp the rusted cutlass, its weight reassuring in your hand, and secure it to your side. The iridescent shells find a new home within the crate, their beauty momentarily forgotten amidst the necessities of survival. You attach the small leather pouch, filled with mystery and secrets, to your belt, its weight a constant reminder of the enigmatic nature of this island. Turning your attention to the gleaming silver amulet, you brush off the sand clinging to its intricate designs. The amulet depicts a fierce, serpentine creature coiled around a stylized sun. The serpent's scales are etched with precision, shimmering in the sunlight, while the sun's rays radiate outward with a sense of power and vitality. Symbols and glyphs encircle the central image, hinting at an ancient language or forgotten lore. Its meaning eludes you for now, but its allure is undeniable. What path will you choose, wayfarer, as you bear these newfound treasures?
